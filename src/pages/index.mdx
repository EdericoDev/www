My nickname is edericodev or edericogames (he/him), and I'm a 15-year-old beginner self-taught developer based in <Badge type="italy" href="https://youtu.be/drojd1HYtcM?si=xvjPnkDNgscCGHqA" label="Italy" />. 

I love open source and I'm always looking for new ideas. I've always been a Windows user. My favorite tools for exploring this awesome world include: VSCode, CodePen, and GitHub.

My journey began a couple of years ago with Discord bots, then I moved to web development and more complete projects. However, I also love coding with languages like C/C++ , Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS (even if they're not coding languages).
I’m keen to try out Rust in the near future.

If you want to see my projects, head up to GitHub!

For the past few years, I've been learning English through Cambridge courses. I'm currently at a [B2](https://www.efset.org/cefr/b2/) level, but I aspire to reach proficiency. When I have spare time, I use <Badge type="duolingo" href=" https://www.duolingo.com/profile/jxst_ede?via=share_profile_qr" label="Duolingo" /> for daily training.

In my free time, I play <Badge type="osu" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/34603157" label="osu!" />. I really enjoy the standard mode. However, I'm not good at mania, catch, or taiko. Check my real-time stats below:

Or sometimes , i use my <Badge type="playstation" href="https://psnprofiles.com/jxst_ede" label="PS5" /> for playing absolute masterpieces.

I also listen to pretty much every genre on <Badge type="spotify" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/31w3g2o6tkydwgjzyuntt42gpi54?si=fdeb7fa8d94e45b7" label="spotify" />. Check what I'm into below:
